Create Credentials Protection WAF Child Policy
==============================================

Currently are policy is simply the original parent policy **waf_base**. Which can be applied to all our application requiring basic application security.  Now we will customize the policy protecting the Hackazon application to protect the login page and create a true child policy.  The child policy will still inherit any changes to the parent policy.

**Task 1 - Simulate credential attacks.**

#. Open browser and go to :guilabel:`http://<f5student#-ext-pip0>/user/login`
#. For **Username** enter :guilabel:`f5student`
#. For **Password.** enter random incorrect password. Repeat 5 consecutive times using different password to simulate brute force attack

   .. NOTE::

      This is a common :guilabel:`brute force` attack. In this case the application allowed
      repeated attempts without lockout.  Some applications will send "account locked"
      for a period of time, however user can continue to repeated attempts to
      elongate lockout period.

#. Open new **incognito browser** and open **developer tools**. (In Chromium for example: **More Tools -> Developer Tools** or right click on the page and select **Inspect**)
#. Browse to :guilabel:`http://<f5student#-ext-pip0>/user/login` and login with **username** :guilabel:`f5student` and **password** :guilabel:`password`
#. Once successfully logged in, review log on Developer Tool. 

   - Select :guilabel:`Network` tab
   - Highlight :guilabel:`login?return_url=`
   - On right panel click :guilabel:`Headers` and scroll to bottom of **Form Data** to view **Username** and **Password**.

The username and password are plain text when the user enters them into the browser, even in HTTPS applications they are not encrypted until the session layer when SSL/TLS encrypts the data stream.  This means the credentials can be obtained by malware in several different ways.

In the next couple of tasks you will help mitigate brute force attacks against the Hackazon application and protect the users credentials as they enter them into the browser.

**Task 2 - Create new waf policy to mitigate the vulnerabilities using info on table below:**

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 40
    :header-rows: 0
    :stub-columns: 0

    * - **Policy Name**
      - waf_baseCredentials
    * - **Policy Type**
      - Security
    * - **Parent Policy**
      - waf_base
    * - **Virtual Server**
      - none
    * - **Enforcement Mode**
      - Blocking

#. Select the **Security -> Application Security -> Security Policies -> Policies List** page
#. Click **Create New Policy** and enter info as shown in image below.

#. Click **Save**

**Task 3 - Configure Brute Force Protection**

Here you will set up brute force protection on the login page you were simulating an attack against earlier.  If you hit the **Sign In** button on the main page, you would have seen another way to log in.  In a production environment different login page would have to be set up to be protected.

#. Select **Security -> Application Security -> Sessions and Logins -> Login Pages List** page
#. Click **Create**

   .. image:: ./images/image342.png
     :height: 500px

#. Fill in the details as in the image above and click on **Create**
#. Select **Security -> Application Security -> Anomaly Detection -> Brute Force Attack Prevention** then click **Create**
#. Change **Login Page** drop down box to :guilabel:`[HTTPS]/user/login` then click **Create**
#. Click **Apply Policy** then **OK** to commit changes

**Task 4 - Assign policies to protect Hackazon App**

#. Select **Local Traffic -> Virtual Servers -> Virtual Servers List** and click on :guilabel:`hackazon_vs`
#. Select **Security** then **Policy** tab
#. Change **Application Security Policy** to :guilabel:`waf_baseCredentials`
#. Enable **Anti-Fraud Profile** and select :guilabel:`protect_credentials`
#. Click **Update**

**Task 5 - Repeat simulated credential attacks**

#. Open browser and go to :guilabel:`http://<f5student#-ext-pip0>/user/login`
#. For **Username** enter :guilabel:`f5student`
#. For **Password** enter random incorrect password.  Repeat multiple times using different password to simulate brute force attack.  You should receive a Captcha challenge after 3-5 failed attempts.
#. Enter **captcha challenge** then enter correct credentials to login in successfully
#. On the BIG-IP go to **Security -> Event Logs -> Application -> Brute Force Attacks** to view the what the BIG-IP logged.
